# Templateparser module for the Booosta PHP Framework

This module provides a template parser for the Booosta PHP Framework. Templates can be loaded from files
holding placeholders like `{%firstname}` which are replaced by values from the script e. g. `$this->TPL['firstname']`

See the [Tutorial](tutorial.md) for further information.

Booosta allows to develop PHP web applications quick. It is mainly designed for small web applications.
It does not provide a strict MVC distinction. Although the MVC concepts influence the framework. Templates,
data objects can be seen as the Vs and Ms of MVC.
